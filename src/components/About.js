                    <p>My name is Denise Nguyen and I am a web developer based in Vancouver, BC. I graduated from BCITâ€™s Computer Information Technology and Technical Web Designer Program. During my time, I developed a passion for web development from working on school projects and by working on software development projects sponsored by BCIT. I enjoy designing simple user interfaces, building web apps, and learning new technologies along the way.</p>
                    <p>I had the opportunity to work as a UI/UX Designer in a summer internship where I was able to first experience designing and developing web applications in the working industry. My team and I went through the process of UX/UI development where we brainstormed, researched, and designed different prototypes for a project. After we agreed on a prototype, I developed a live version of this application using React.js. Based on my experience using React.js, I want to pursue more on the development side.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am seeking a web development job where I want to explore and challenge myself with new technologies and opportunities.</p>
